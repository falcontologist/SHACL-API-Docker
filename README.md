# SHACL-API-Docker

This readme text was generated by Gemini.

A FastAPI-based backend engine for RDF data validation and dynamic form generation. This API serves as the source of truth for the **Verbs to Situations** project by processing SHACL shapes to drive user interface forms and validating Turtle-formatted graph data.

## 🚀 Overview
This project provides a robust, future-proof bridge between a static frontend and a standardized SHACL validation engine. It uses **RDFLib** for graph traversal and **PySHACL** for standard-compliant validation.

## 📁 Repository Structure
* `app.py`: The Python FastAPI application.
* `Dockerfile`: Instructions for containerizing the application.
* `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `rdflib`, `pyshacl`).
* `roles_shacl.ttl`: The SHACL shapes file defining situations, roles, and constraints.

## 🛠️ Local Setup (Docker)
To run this API locally using Docker:

1.  **Build the image**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t shacl-api .
    ```
2.  **Run the container**:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 shacl-api
    ```
3.  **Access the API**: The service will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## 📡 API Endpoints

### `GET /api/forms`
Returns a JSON schema derived from `roles_shacl.ttl`. This is used by the frontend to dynamically generate input fields for each situation domain.

### `POST /api/validate`
Accepts a Turtle-formatted string and validates it against the SHACL shapes.
* **Request Body**: `{"turtle_data": "..."}`
* **Response**: Returns a boolean `conforms` status and a detailed `report_text` if violations are found.

## ☁️ Deployment
This repository is optimized for deployment on **Render** or **Railway**:
1.  Connect this GitHub repository to your hosting service.
2.  Ensure the environment is set to **Docker**.
3.  The service will automatically build and provide a public URL for your CodePen frontend.
